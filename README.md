### Developing locally ðŸ’»
After youâ€™ve cloned your project, install the dependencies and run the local development server:

```

Link your local development environment to your Shopify store to render your product inventory data:

```bash
npx shopify hydrogen link --storefront "shopify-headless"
```

Linking your project automatically keeps your local environment variables in sync with Oxygen, allows you to query your store data, and lets you create deployments from the command line at any time. Check the complete list of Hydrogen CLI for a complete list of features.

```bash
npx shopify hydrogen env pull
```

```bash
# Deploy to Oxygen
npx shopify hydrogen deploy
